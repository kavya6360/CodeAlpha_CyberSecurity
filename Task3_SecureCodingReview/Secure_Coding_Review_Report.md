# Secure Coding Review Report

## Insecure Code Issues
- Password was stored directly in the code
- Password was visible in plain text
- Easy for attackers to guess credentials

## Secure Improvements
- Password is hashed using SHA-256
- Sensitive information is protected
- Login system is more secure

## Learning Outcome
I learned how insecure coding can cause security risks
and how secure coding practices can protect applications.
